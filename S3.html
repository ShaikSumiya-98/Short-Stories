    <center><h1>The Blind Girl</h1></center>

    <p style="font-size: large;">There was a blind girl who hated herself purely for the fact she was blind. The only person she didn’t hate was her loving boyfriend, as he was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry him.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her – now she could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her,<b>“now that you can see the world, will you marry me?”</b></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying:</p>
    <center><p style="font-size: large;"><b>“Just take care of my eyes dear.”</b></p></center>
