    <p style="font-size: large;">There was a farmer who sold a pound of butter to a baker. One day the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he was getting the right amount, which he wasn’t. Angry about this, he took the farmer to court.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The judge asked the farmer if he was using any measure to weight the butter. The farmer replied, “Honor, I am primitive. I don’t have a proper measure, but I do have a scale.”</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The judge asked, “Then how do you weigh the butter?”</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The farmer replied;</p>
    <center><p style="font-size: large;"><b>“Your Honor, long before the baker started buying butter from me, I have been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when the baker brings the bread, I put it on the scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it is the baker.”</b></p></center>

    <p style="font-size: large;"><b>In life, you get what you give. Don’t try and cheat others.</b></p>
