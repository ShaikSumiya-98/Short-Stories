    <center><h1>Thinking Out of the Box</h1></center>
    <center><img src="./c2.webp" alt=""></center>
    <p style="font-size: large;">In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner’s daughter.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">He decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman’s daughter.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><b>The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.</b></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn’t have to marry the loan-shark.</p>
    <img align="right" src="./c.jpg" alt="" height="250px" width="300px"><p style="font-size: large;">Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman’s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he’d <b>picked up two black pebbles and placed</b> them both into the bag.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><b>He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.</b></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">1.Refuse to pick a pebble from the bag.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">2.Take both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">3.Pick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father’s freedom.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">She drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it ‘accidentally’ dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;</p>
    <center><p style="font-size: large;"><b>“Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.”</b></p></center>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn’t want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father’s debt.</p>
    <h2><p style="font-size: large;">Moral of the Story:</p></h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><i>It’s always possible to <b>overcome a tough situation</b> throughout of the box thinking, and not give in to the only options you think you have to pick from.</i></p>
